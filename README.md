# NLP Assignments Suite

A comprehensive collection of NLP assignments covering fundamental concepts and practical implementations.

## Project Structure

### Assignment 1: NLP Preprocessing
- Text preprocessing techniques including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, POS tagging, and NER
- FastAPI backend with interactive web interface
- Comparative analysis of stemming vs lemmatization

### Assignment 2: Word Embeddings
- Implementation of word embeddings (TF-IDF and GloVe)
- Interactive visualization of word vectors
- Nearest neighbor analysis and dimensionality reduction

### Assignment 3: Sequence-to-Sequence Summarization
- LSTM-based encoder-decoder model for text summarization
- Training and evaluation notebooks
- Sample dataset for model training

## Setup Instructions

Each assignment directory contains its own `requirements.txt` file. To get started:

1. Navigate to the specific assignment directory
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Unix/MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Technologies Used

- NLP Libraries: NLTK, spaCy
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn, gensim
- Deep Learning: TensorFlow/Keras
- Web Framework: FastAPI
- Frontend: HTML, JavaScript
